# DO NOT CHEAT.

I've created these programs for my own homework: I'm not putting them up so that others can steal something that I've spent time and effort on and pass it off as their own.

I'm putting them up so I can learn.

It is my hope that by sharing them with a larger community I can grow my knowledge of MIPS through critique and practice.

Plus I missed using git.
